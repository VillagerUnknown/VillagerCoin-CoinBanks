# VillagerUnknown's Coin Banks for Villager Coin

_This is an addon mod for Villager Coin._

Adds various Coin Banks to Villager Coin that hold the total value of the coins added. 

* Coins can be added to a Coin Bank by holding a stack of coins in your hand and interacting (right-clicking) on a Coin Bank to add the coin, and it's value, to the bank.
* If broken with silk touch, Coin Banks can be picked up with their value (similar to a Shulker Box). 
* If broken without silk touch, the bank breaks and the total value of the bank drops in the form of the largest coins.
